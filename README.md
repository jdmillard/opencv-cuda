## OpenCV Testing

Under Construction

### Some Specifics

A working example with comments is provided.

For automatic CUDA use the following is assumed
* assumes installed `CUDA` and ran the test
* compile `OpenCV` from source (with default install directory)
* I need to figure out this `export OpenCV_DIR=/usr/local/share/OpenCV/` can it be but in `CMakeLists.txt`?

### Run Commands
```bash
cd build/
cmake ..
make
./nameHERE
```
